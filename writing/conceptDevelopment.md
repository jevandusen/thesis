### 1. Ideation
***Mind Map***

        *  Where did they come form and where did they go?
        *  How long were they there for?
        *  How far did they travel?
        *  Was there a gender disparity?
        *  Was there a regional disparity?
        *  What was/is their life expectancy compared to outside the system?

        *  Day to day responsibilities
        *  Overall responsibilities
        *  Government and RCMP involvement
        *  Church involvement
        *  Funding

        *  Today's reservations
        *  Substance abuse, suicide epidemic, missing and murdered Indigenous women


### 2. Understanding Audiences
***Audience***
* General readers who know little about the topic
    *  Most readers will know it exists, but are not well-informed and have not been educated about it
    *  General population: readers who are interested in learning more
    *  First Nations peoples who would like to quanitify/qualify their experiences or those of their ancestors
*  Professionals who expect me to follow every academic convention and use a standard format
    *  Educators looking to teacg about this topic or use my visualization as a learning tool
    *  Professionals at National Library, National Cenre for Truth and Reconciliation
    

***Audience Expectations***
* Provide new factual knowledge
* Help them udnerstand my topic better
    *  Provide a tool for educating readers/students/people in general about the topic
    *  Provide evidence for a topic they know little about


***Audience Knowledge***
* Most viewers will know that the NTRC existed and that the government made an apology, as well as a very basic understanding that the Indian Residential School System existed, but more will not fully understand what it was
    *  Most will not understand the vastness, importance, or impact
* First Nations, Metis, and Inuit readers will have a more in-depth knowledge
* Educators will have a more in-depth knowledge
* Most readers will recognize the school system as a problem and horrific time in Canada's history and that it is a problem for all Canadians and one that mus be taken seriously
 

***Audience Response***
* For most, the visualization will/should confirm/qualify/quanitify what they already know
* For some, the data may contradict what they believed to be true (ie. the government's justification or reasoning, or the general explanation taught to older generations)
* What are some arguments against it?
    *  Is it ethical to use this data?
    *  ..
        *  The justifications or explanations employed by the government and the church
*  What's new about it?
    *  This data has not been visualized before, or even made easily available to general public or to First Nations peoples


### 3. Evidence and Data
***Sources***
* What kind of evidence is expected?
    *  Qualitative data
        *  Personal stories and accounts
        *  School-by-school narratives
            *  Policy information
            *  Building information
            *  Abuse reports
        *  Reservation data
            *  Treaty information
    *  Quantitative data
        *  Hard data from each school
            *  Enrolment information
            *  Location information
            *  Administration, funding information
            *  Student base information
        *  Church and government data
        *  Reservation data
            *  Size and border information
            *  Population data
            *  Treaty information
* Where does this data come from?
    *  NCTR (National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation)
        *  School-by-school narratives (primary - qualitative and quantitative)
        *  Personal archives, personal accounts and stories (primary - qualitative)
    *  Stats Canada
        *  Reservation data, population data (primary - quantitative)
    *  NTRC (National Truth and Reconciliation Commission)
        *  Reports, summaries, histories, recommendations (secondary - qualitative and quantitative)
    *  Books containing personal stories and accounts (secondary - qualitative)
*  Primary vs Secondary Sources
    *  Primary sources are based on historical records, documented at the time and place fo the event, or personal stories directly provided by the subject
    *  Secondary sources are reports, summaries, and histories written based on other primary sources or collections of personal stories collected and summarized by somebody other than the subject


### 4. Synthesising Topics

1. **I'm visualizing** historical data about the Canadian Indian Residential School System **because I want to** explore student enrolment in the system -- where they came from, which reserves, tribes, and bands they left behind, and how and when they returned -- **in order to** better understand the movement of indigenous populations across Canada.

2. **I'm visualizing** current and historical data about First Nations, Metis, and Inuit reservations in Canada **because I want to** explore how they have changed and moved over time **in order to** understand how *actual* First Nations land compares to that promised by government treaties.

3. **I'm visualizing** historical data and personal accounts about the Canadian Indian Residential School System **because I want to** explore the day-to-day lives and welfare of its students **in order to** communicate what happened in these places.

4. **I'm visualizing** historical data about the Canadian Indian Residential School System **because I want to** explore not only who was responsible for implementing and running the system, but also how those parties are taking responsibility for it **in order to** better understand the roles played by the Canadian government, the church, the RCMP, and others, as well as the system's impact on today's First Nations, Metis, and Inuit.


### 5. Prototyping

***Format***
*  Mapping/Geographic
    *  User viewer's current location to show data/stories nearby and ground/humanize the data
*  Intuitive, scroll-based interactivity
    *  Mobile friendly, easy to use, no extra clicks or hover required
*  Personal
    *  Use personal accounts and stories to humanize data
    *  Use narrative to tell story of the data
