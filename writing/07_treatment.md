### <a id="intro"></a> 1.Introduction
On the morning of Wednesday, June 11, 2008, a circle of eleven chairs was added to the floor of the House of Commons. That morning, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an extraordinary apology. In the chairs were five Aboriginal leaders and six residential school survivors, each considered a guest of honour for this remarkable event. The apology was for the Indian Residential School system, the government’s policy of assimilation and forced enfranchisement, and the damage they both caused to Aboriginal children, their culture, and their way of life. The apology, given by Harper on behalf of the federal government and Canada as a country, was long overdue.

> “Today, we recognize that [Canada’s historic] policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country. The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long.  The burden is properly ours as a Government, and as a country.  There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian Residential Schools system to ever prevail again. You have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey. The Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly.” (Harper 2008)


####  <a id="context"></a> 1.1 Context and Goals
Since the Government of Canada’s apology in 2008, several provinces and territories have joined various religious and educational institutions in issuing formal acknowledgments, admissions, and expressions of sorrow for the damage caused by Canada’s residential schools. The apologies, along with help from the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission (NTRC), has led to comprehensive details regarding the schools and their students’ welfare entering public knowledge and reaching mainstream media. These details included school-by-school demographics, extensive accounts of physical and sexual abuse, reports of malnourishment and poor living conditions, and descriptions of punishment and assimilation policies. This information comes from an abundance of original, historical documents kept by the government and the church throughout the existence of the Indian Residential School system (IRS), collected by the NTRC and digitized by the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR).

The data, while published digitally by the NCTR and NTRC, is difficult to access and in many cases, even more difficult to understand. This project aims to bring this knowledge to life, making the data and its story tangible by visually investigating the IRS system. The visualization begins with the narrative of a single school: its student demographics, policies, everyday life, and management; and how it changes over the school’s lifetime. It continues by looking at the larger network geographically (i.e. where the schools were located in relation to urban centres, First Nations reservations, and “white” schools, as well as where their students came from). Finally, school data is analyzed in a purely qualitative sense, incorporating the personal stories and accounts of survivors, as well as the NCTR, NTRC, and Canadian government’s steps towards reconciliation. This process involves synthesizing the various resources, documentation, and data sources listed below, both qualitative and quantitative, to tell the story of Canada’s Indian Residential Schools.


####  <a id="background"></a> 1.2 Background

Beginning long before Confederation in 1867, Canada’s residential schools were primarily active following the approval of the Indian Act in 1876 — a group of laws aiming to do away with the Indian tribal system and forcibly enfranchise First Nations peoples. “An education system in name only for much of its existence” (Truth and Reconciliation Canada 2015, v), the system was made up of one hundred and thirty-two federally supported institutions [^as recognized by the federal government]. The most recently operating school, Gordon Indian Residential School in Punnichy, Saskatchewan, closed in 1996. The system removed an estimated 150,000 Aboriginal children from their families, their homes, and their way of life in every Canadian province and territory, not including Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick. The schools were funded by the federal government, while day-to-day operations at a majority of schools were the responsibility of various religious groups, including the Anglican, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and United churches.


####  <a id="audience"></a> 1.3 Audience

This project is aimed at various audiences. While many Canadians are aware of this part of Canada’s past, most are unaware of its immensity. For them, the general population, the project serves as a way to easily and intuitively learn more, and also relate better to the information presented by the NTRC and understand the progress of the commission’s attempts at reconciliation. The residential school system is slowly being introduced to primary and secondary school curriculums, so for educators, the project can serve as a valuable tool for teaching. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the visualization can work for First Nations peoples looking to qualify and quantify their experiences and those of their ancestors, while also working to help continue the tradition of passing down stories and knowledge to future generations. The final visualization will be available in various mediums, including large screen format for incorporation into the NCTR’s archives and exhibitions, tablet format for researchers and educators, and in print for classroom use and those without computer access.


####  <a id="datause"></a>  1.4 Data Use

To fully understand the IRS system and present it in a form appropriate to the sensitivity of the subject, both quantitative and qualitative data must be considered. While quantitative data, like numbers, statistics, and geographic data, can help create complex and informative visualizations, the real comprehension and appreciation of the IRS system lie within the qualitative data: the stories and personal accounts of its survivors. This kind of data is more difficult to attain and present than measurable data and will be treated with the highest level of respect. This project makes use of both data types to tell the stories of the schools. A general outline of the utilized data follows.

Quantitative data includes:
- School-by-school data
	- Enrolment, student age and sex, and student base
	- Locations, names, and facilities
	- Administration
	- Funding and operation
- Government and church data
- Reservation data
	- Sizes, borders, and locations
	- Populations
	- Treaties
- Reconciliation data
	- Payments

Qualitative data includes:
- Personal stories and accounts
- School-by-school data
	- Policies
	- Buildings
	- Abuse reports
- Reservation data
	- Treaties
- Reconciliation data
	- Apologies
	- NTRC recommendations

Data sources include the reports of the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the digital and physical archives of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, Statistics Canada surveys and censuses, voluntarily provided reports from the Catholic Church, and primary and secondary sources containing personal stories. 


###  <a id="irs"></a> 2. The Indian Residential School System

#### <a id="understanding"></a> 2.1 Understanding

##### <a id="terminology"></a> 2.1.1 Terminology, Organizations, and Definitions

For the purposes of this study, and indeed, as defined by the Government of Canada and the commission that investigated it, the Indian Residential School (IRS) system refers to one hundred and thirty two schools across ten Canadian provinces and territories — there were no schools in the maritime provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, or New Brunswick. The term “residential school” refers to boarding schools, at which most or all students live while in attendance, and which, in the case of the IRS system, were often located on or near native reservations.

The National Truth and Reconciliation Commission (NTRC) was established on June 2, 2008, and was completed in late 2015. It was created as part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, which settled class actions between the Canadian government and approximately 86,000 IRS survivors. Its purpose was to “promote reconciliation within a society as a whole” by discovering, clarifying, and formally acknowledging past abuses in the IRS system “to outline institutional responsibility and recommend reforms” (Rice and Snyder 2012, 48). The NTRC followed examples set by commissions of the same name in Chile, 1990, and South Africa, 2001; however, the Canadian commission fell under criticism early in its life for its use of the term ‘reconciliation.’ To reconcile means to restore a once harmonious relationship, made clear in the NTRC’s final report: “a critical part of this [reconciliation] process involves repairing damaged trust” (Truth and Reconciliation Canada 2015, 16) — a trust and relationship which many indigenous peoples in Canada maintain never existed between them and the government (Garneau 2012, 113). 

The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR), housed in Chancellor’s Hall at the University of Manitoba, is a permanent home for all curated materials related to the IRS system. This includes thousands of hours of video, millions of government and church records, and the survivor statements collected by the NTRC between 2008 and 2015. The centre also supports ongoing research to, according to the NTRC chair, make sure the ”full history of the schools will always be available to all Canadians” (Dehaas 2015, par. 3-5).

It is also important to note that the terms ‘Aboriginal peoples of Canada’ and ‘Canadian indigenous peoples’ generally, and for the purpose of this investigation, refer to three groups. The First Nations, the predominant Aboriginal peoples of Canada south of the arctic; the Inuit, located in the arctic area; and the Métis, a third and distinctive group which developed after European contact are each recognized as one of Canada’s aboriginal peoples under Canada’s Constitution (Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada 2012). All three groups are represented by the estimated 150,000 students who attended residential schools (Miller 2012, par. 1).

##### <a id="history"></a>2.2.1 Early History and Precursors

While residential schools were primarily active following the implementation of assimilative policies in the late 1800s, they are rooted in practices from much earlier. The first residential facilities were developed by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits, and Ursulines in New France (c. 17th century). Their purpose was to provide care and schooling for the children of natives and to assist in early attempts to assimilate the indigenous populations of the New World. (Miller 2012, par. 2) This “‘civilizing mission’ rested on a belief of racial and cultural superiority” (Truth and Reconciliation Canada 2015, 46). The early attempts of Catholic missionaries ultimately failed, however, as their efforts were resisted by Aboriginal peoples, whom colonialists depended on economically and militarily (Miller 2012, par. 2). The establishment of day and boarding schools was abandoned, yet the policies of assimilation and cultural belief of superiority continued, setting the stage for post-Confederation policies.


##### <a id="assimilation"></a>2.2.2 Assimilation

While Aboriginal peoples were valuable military allies in wars between Canada and the United States in the 17th and 18th centuries, their role waned when fighting between the two nations subsided. Large numbers of settlers arrived from Europe, their population outgrowing that of the First Nations, leading British Administrators to take a new look at their relationship with indigenous peoples. Their approach was “based on the assumption that in order to function within Canada, Aboriginal peoples need to adopt a “Canadian” identity and abandon their cultures and traditions” (Indigenous Foundations par. 3). A Department of the Interior annual report (Parliament 1877, xiv) describes government policies at the time as this:

> “Our Indian legislation generally rests on the principle, that the aborigines are to be kept in a condition of tutelage and treated as wards or children of the State. The true interests of the aborigines and of the State alike require that every effort should be made to aid the Red man in lifting himself out of his condition of tutelage and dependence, and that is clearly our wisdom and our duty, through education and every other means, to prepare him for a higher civilization by encouraging him to assume the privileges and responsibilities of full citizenship.”

From Confederation in 1867 onward, the government’s official stance was one of assimilation. Government officials embarked on a mission to rid Canada of its ‘Indian problem’, continuing “until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question” (Canada 1899, xxiii). At the end of this process, “Aboriginal people were expected to have ceased to exist as a distinct people with their own governments, cultures, and identities” (Truth and Reconciliation Canada 2015, 53). This began with the passing of the Indian Act in 1876.


##### <a id="indianact"></a>2.2.3 The Indian Act

Although formally passed by Parliament in 1876, the Indian Act is based on laws and policies dating back to at least 1763, when a Royal Proclamation laid down the basis for the colonial administration’s relationship with First Nations. The Proclamation promised protections to First Nations peoples and initiated the process by which settlers could obtain their lands. The proclamation led to further acts being passed later in the 18th and 19th centuries, all with the purpose of assimilating natives into the European way of life (Henderson 2006, par. 4). When the province of Canada (divided into Ontario and Quebec) united with the British colonies of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to become the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the newly passed Constitution Act provided the federal government with “legislative jurisdiction over Indians and lands reserved for the Indians” (Canada 1867). Eleven years later, in 1876, Parliament passed the Indian Act, which combined and replaced any laws regarding First Nations passed by a local or provincial government before Confederation.

The Indian Act was a unification and strengthening of the Gradual Civilization Act and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act, and formally incorporated the inferior social status of Aboriginal peoples into Canadian law. The law forced First Nations, Métis, and Inuit onto reserve lands and made them legal wards of the state (Belanger 2014, 117). The Indian Act made Canada’s stance on assimilation official and was used as a tool of cultural destruction. An amendment in 1884 mandated that educating Aboriginal children be the responsibility of the federal government, leading to the creation of a system of state-funded residential schools, to be administered by the church.
