An analysis of student (and survivor) life and welfare in Canada's Indian Residential School System

LAWS AND ACTS
  Indian Act, 1876 (link)
  Amendment to the Indian Act, 1894

BACKGROUND
A network of residential/boarding schools for Indigenous peoples in Canada (First Nations (Indians), Metis, and Inuit)

  Purpose
    Remove children from influence of Aboriginal culture
    Assimilate children in dominant Canadian culture
      Stated goal: convert indigenous children to Christianity and to "civilize" them
    Why did this happen?
      Imperial colonialism
        Doctrine of Discovery (link)
          Justification of colonial powers laying claims to lands during "Age of Discovery"
        "Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves. The ‘civilizing mission’ rested on a belief of racial and cultural superiority.
      "Kill the Indian, save the man"
        Integrate Indigenous people with European-Canadian society
  Scope
    Approx. 30% of native children (150,000)
    Ext. 6000 died while in attendance
  Timeline
    1830s -- 1996
      Many unaware of existence so recently
      Primarily active after Indian Act of 1876
      Last federally-operated school closed in 1996
    Compulsory from 1894 -- 1948
  Locations
    Nationwide
  Types
    Day Schools
    Hostels
    Industrial Schools
    Residential Schools
      Remote, large distance from reserves
        Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued for schools at greater distances to cut down on family visits that he viewed as counteracting the "civilizing" of Indigenous children
      Intentional
