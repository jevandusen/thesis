# Canada's Indian Residential School System
#### Thesis Synopsis/Abstract - Draft (15 March 2017)

[need a header sentence to introduce the IRS system real quick]
While many schools originated long before Confederation in 1867, the Indian Residential School System was primarily active following the approval of the Indian Act â€” a group of laws aiming to do away with the Indian tribal system and forcibly enfranchise First Nations peoples -- in 1876 until the the last federally-operated school closed in 1996.

Overall, there were 130 (?) schools, as recognized by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and not including various Metis and Inuit institutions, in which roughly 150,000 native children were placed, throughout all 10 provinces and all three territories. The schools were funded by the Canadian Government and operated by various religious groups.

In recent years and in light of official apologies issued by the Government of Canada, individual provinces and territories, the Vatican, and church groups, information about the schools and their students' welfare has become public knowledge: physical and sexual abuse was common, both between students and involving administrators; malnourishment and poor living conditions were typical; and assimilation, deprivation of culture traditions, and punishment was the standard. It is estimated that 6000 children died while in attendance.

This project aims to investigate the IRS system, beginning with the narrative of a single school, its student demographics, policies, everyday life, and management, and visualizing how it fits into the larger network by synthesizing various resources, documentation, and data sources.

#### Issues and Dependancies
* Haven't heard back from NCTR, will continue to work without their input and trying to get in touch.
* Rate of data extraction with Amazon Mechanical Turk has slowed down -- I have enough data to get started and will be able to add in more as it is completed.

#### Feature List
* Make hard-to-access NCTR and NTRC data tangible and available to all Canadians
* Understand the IRS system through personal stories and qualitative informaiton
* Provide a home for IRS data outside of government databases
* Track reconcilation attempts and recommdation progress
